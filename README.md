# LCMS-Net: Deep learning for cause-of-death prediction

## Overview

Current preprocessing workflows for untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) are often time-consuming, require extensive domain knowledge, lack reproducibility, or fail to detect some metabolites entirely. Here, we present LCMS-Net, an end-to-end deep learning model for the analysis of LC-HRMS data. Our method operates directly on raw data and explicitly models its spatial properties to utilize all available information.
